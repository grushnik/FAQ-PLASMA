## 🔬 Plasma fundamentals

### What is gas plasma?
Gas plasma is an ionized gas formed when energy is applied to a neutral gas, creating a mixture of electrons, ions, neutrals, radicals, and excited species that can conduct electricity and drive chemical reactions. Depending on the energy input, it can be cold (non-thermal) or hot (thermal).

### What are examples of plasma?
Natural examples include lightning, auroras, and the Sun. Man-made plasma includes neon lights, arc welding plasma, plasma cutting torches, and microwave or RF plasma used in laboratories and industry.

### How long does plasma live?
Plasma exists only while energy is supplied. Once power is removed, recombination occurs in microseconds to milliseconds, depending on pressure, gas composition, and temperature.

## 🔥 Plasma torches and operation

### Why are plasma torches used?
Plasma torches provide extremely energetic, controllable environments that enable reactions and processes impossible with conventional heat or chemistry, such as waste destruction, gas reforming, and advanced material synthesis.

### What types of plasma torches exist?
Common types include:
- Arc plasma torches
- Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP)
- Microwave plasma torches
- DC and AC industrial plasma systems
- Low-pressure (cold) plasma sources

### What’s the difference between cold and hot plasma?
Cold plasma has energetic electrons but low bulk gas temperature.  
Hot (thermal) plasma operates at thousands of Kelvin and approaches local thermodynamic equilibrium.

### What temperature does microwave plasma operate at?
Thermal microwave plasma typically operates at **3,000–6,000 K**, while non-thermal microwave plasma keeps bulk gas near ambient temperature.

## ⚛ Plasma chemistry and kinetics

### What happens at 3,000–6,000 K?
At these temperatures, molecules rapidly dissociate, atoms ionize, and reactions occur on nanosecond timescales. This enables destruction of strong chemical bonds (CO₂, CH₄, PFAS) and high-enthalpy chemistry.

## 🧪 Applications

### What are typical applications of microwave plasma?
Applications include:
- Surface treatment
- Carbon black and nanoparticle synthesis
- Plasma-activated water
- Nitrogen fixation and NOₓ production
- PFAS destruction
- CO₂ conversion and methane reforming
- Hydrogen production
- Waste-to-energy processes

### How can plasma produce carbon black?
Hydrocarbon gases rapidly decompose at high temperature, forming carbon black nanoparticles and hydrogen.

### How does plasma destroy PFAS?
High-temperature plasma breaks strong C–F bonds, converting PFAS into simpler, non-persistent compounds with very high destruction efficiency.

## 🧠 Radom technology

### What is Cerawave™?
Cerawave™ is Radom’s proprietary ceramic resonator that improves microwave-to-plasma coupling, ignition reliability, stability, and efficiency in electrode-free plasma torches.

### What is the minimum plasma power Radom provides?
Radom’s minimum plasma torch operates at **1000 W**, producing plasma temperatures around **3000 °C**.

### Why is argon used for ignition?
Argon ionizes easily and enables stable, low-voltage plasma ignition before transitioning to process gases such as air, nitrogen, or CO₂.

## ⚙ System integration and control

### What components are included in a plasma system?
A minimum system includes a power supply, control module, and torch head. Higher-power systems include auto-tuners, cooling, gas handling, and safety subsystems.

### Can Radom plasma be integrated into custom systems?
Yes. Radom torches can be integrated into custom reactors and PLC infrastructures with appropriate safety and control configuration.

### Can plasma be controlled remotely?
Yes. Full control is available via SDK/DLL and can be accessed through PLCs, LabVIEW, or Python.

---

## 🦺 Safety

### Is plasma safe to operate?
Yes, when proper precautions are followed. UV-rated safety glasses, ventilation, and high-voltage safety procedures are required.

### Why is exhaust required?
Plasma operated in air can generate NOₓ gases, which are hazardous and must be ventilated properly.

---

## 📦 Logistics, service, and support

### Does Radom ship internationally?
Yes, subject to standard export regulations.

### Is Radom technology patented?
Yes. Key components such as Cerawave™ are protected by patents and proprietary know-how.

### Does Radom provide service and support?
Yes. Radom offers installation, training, troubleshooting, and long-term support.
