      <h1>Frequently asked questions about Radom plasma technology</h1>

      <h2>What is gas plasma?</h2>
      <p>Gas plasma is an ionized gas formed when energy is applied to a neutral gas, creating a mixture of electrons, ions, neutrals, radicals, and excited species that can conduct electricity and drive chemical reactions. Depending on the energy input, it can be cold (non-thermal), where the ions and neutrals remain near ambient temperature, or hot (thermal), where the entire gas reaches very high temperatures, enabling applications such as material processing, chemical conversion, sterilization, and environmental treatment.</p>

      <h2>What are examples of plasma?</h2>
      <p>Common examples of plasma include lightning, auroras, and the Sun and other stars, where gases are naturally ionized at high energy. Man-made examples include neon and fluorescent lights, arc welding plasmas, plasma cutting torches, and microwave or radio-frequency plasma used in laboratories and industry for materials processing and chemical conversion.</p>

      <h2>How long does plasma live?</h2>
      <p>Plasma does not have a fixed “lifetime” on its own—it exists only as long as energy is supplied to sustain ionization. When the power is on, plasma can be maintained continuously for seconds, hours, or indefinitely in steady-state operation; when the power is turned off, the plasma typically recombines and disappears in microseconds to milliseconds, depending on pressure, gas composition, and temperature.</p>

      <h2>Why are plasma torches used to generate plasma?</h2>
      <p>People create plasma in torches because it provides a highly energetic, controllable environment that can drive reactions and processes impossible or inefficient with conventional heat or chemistry. Plasma torches deliver extreme temperatures, reactive species, and strong electromagnetic coupling, enabling rapid chemical conversion, material synthesis, destruction of persistent contaminants, surface modification, and energy-efficient processing in applications such as waste treatment, gas reforming, materials production, and advanced research.</p>

      <h2>What type of plasma torches exist?</h2>
      <p>Plasma torches are commonly classified by how plasma is generated and sustained. Arc plasma torches use an electrical arc between electrodes and are widely used for cutting, welding, and thermal processing. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) torches use radio-frequency electromagnetic fields to generate plasma without electrodes, enabling clean, stable operation for analytical and materials applications. Microwave plasma torches use microwave energy to sustain plasma at atmospheric or reduced pressure and are valued for high efficiency, electrode-free operation, and precise control. DC and AC plasma torches are often used in high-power industrial systems, while low-pressure (cold) plasma sources are used for surface treatment and sterilization.</p>

      <h2>What’s the difference between cold plasma and hot plasma?</h2>
      <p>Cold plasma operates at low bulk gas temperatures while maintaining highly energetic electrons, making it well suited for heat-sensitive applications, as cold plasma operates far from thermal equilibrium. In contrast, hot (thermal) plasma operates at very high gas temperatures, typically thousands of Kelvin, and approaches local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), where electrons, ions, and neutral species all possess high and comparable energies.</p>

      <h2>What temperature range does microwave plasma usually operate in?</h2>
      <p>The typical temperature of microwave plasma depends on the operating regime: in thermal (hot) microwave plasma, gas temperatures are usually in the range of 3,000–6,000 K and can exceed 7,000 K in some configurations, while in non-thermal (cold) microwave plasma, electrons are highly energetic but the bulk gas temperature remains near room temperature up to a few hundred degrees Celsius; atmospheric-pressure microwave plasma torches used for materials processing, gas conversion, and waste treatment therefore commonly operate at thousands of Kelvin.</p>

      <h2>What kinds of gas-phase kinetics occur at the 3,000–6,000 K temperatures typical of thermal microwave plasma?</h2>
      <p>At 3,000–6,000 K in a thermal (hot) microwave plasma, the gas undergoes extreme kinetic and chemical activity driven by very high particle energies. Molecules rapidly dissociate into atoms, and a significant fraction of atoms become ionized, forming a dense mixture of electrons, ions, radicals, and excited species. Collisions occur on nanosecond timescales, enabling fast reaction kinetics, high diffusion rates, and near-equilibrium chemistry. These conditions allow otherwise stable molecules (such as CO₂, CH₄, or PFAS) to break strong chemical bonds, drive endothermic reactions, and form new species, which is why hot microwave plasma is effective for gas reforming, materials synthesis, and destruction of persistent compounds.</p>

      <h2>What are typical applications of microwave plasma?</h2>
      <p>Atmospheric-pressure microwave plasma sources are used for surface treatment, nanoparticle and carbon black production, plasma-activated water (PAW) generation, microbial cleaning, nitrogen fixation and NOx production, PFAS destruction, wastewater treatment, CO₂ conversion, methane reforming, hydrogen production, waste-to-energy and waste-to-X processes, mining waste treatment, gasification, and high-enthalpy plasma research including plasma-assisted propulsion and reentry simulation.</p>

      <h2>What is CerawaveTM and what difference does it make?</h2>
      <p>Cerawave™ is Radom’s proprietary ceramic resonator used inside our microwave plasma torches to efficiently couple microwave energy into the plasma. Its unique chemical composition and dielectric properties reduce heat losses while shaping and stabilizing the electromagnetic field around the discharge, improving power transfer, ignition reliability, and plasma stability over a wide operating range. Compared to conventional applicator designs, Cerawave™ enables electrode-free operation, higher efficiency, and more repeatable plasma performance with reduced sensitivity to gas composition and flow variations.</p>

      <h2>How can plasma be used to produce carbon black?</h2>
      <p>In thermal plasma, hydrocarbon gases (e.g. methane) are rapidly decomposed at high temperature, forming carbon black nanoparticles and hydrogen.</p>

      <h2>How does plasma destroy PFAS (and what results can be expected)?</h2>
      <p>High-temperature plasma breaks strong C–F bonds through thermal dissociation and reactive plasma species, converting PFAS into simpler, non-persistent compounds. Laboratory and pilot results show very high destruction efficiency when operated under appropriate conditions.</p>

      <h2>Can microwave-based plasma be used for sterilization?</h2>
      <p>Microwave plasma can be used for sterilization, but hot atmospheric plasma is generally unsuitable for heat-sensitive materials. Low-pressure (cold) plasma may be viable, though it typically requires additional development and validation for regulated sterilization applications.</p>

      <h2>Can microwave plasma be used for air cleaning or pollutant removal?</h2>
      <p>Yes. Microwave plasma can break down pollutants, VOCs, and hazardous compounds in air streams through a combination of high temperature and reactive plasma species. The effectiveness depends on gas composition, residence time, and system design; however, nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) may also form during the process and must be managed accordingly.</p>

      <h2>What is the minimum power plasma torch that Radom corporation provides?</h2>
      <p>The minimum power plasma torch provided by Radom Corporation operates at 1000 W, which is sufficient to generate plasma temperatures of approximately 3000 °C and sustain gas flow rates on the order of 10–20 L/min, depending on the gas composition and operating conditions.</p>

      <h2>Why do I need argon to ignite Radom’s plasma torches?</h2>
      <p>Argon is used to ignite Radom’s plasma torches because it ionizes easily and provides a stable, low-breakdown-voltage path for plasma initiation. Its inert nature and simple atomic structure allow reliable ignition at lower power. Once the plasma is established, the system can transition to the desired process gas (such as air, nitrogen, CO₂, or hydrocarbons) while maintaining stable operation.</p>

      <h2>What are the typical components of the plasma torch system?</h2>
      <p>In its minimum configuration, a 1000 W Radom plasma torch system consists of three main components: the power supply, the control module, and the plasma torch head. For higher-power systems (10 kW and above), additional components are required, such as auto-tuner and matching hardware, enhanced cooling, expanded gas handling, and safety subsystems to ensure stable and reliable operation.</p>

      <h2>Can I integrate a Radom plasma torch into my own plasma infrastructure?</h2>
      <p>Yes, it is possible. Radom plasma torches are built according to industrial standards and can be integrated into custom or existing plasma infrastructure. Depending on the specifics, some adjustments or additional components may be required to ensure proper compatibility, safety, and stable operation.</p>

      <h2>Does Radom corporation provide all required components for turnkey plasma torch set up and operation?</h2>
      <p>Yes, Radom provides all the required components for turnkey operation. All components are fully integrated; all wiring is clearly labeled, and safety goggles are included. The system also comes with control software compatible with a standard laptop for immediate setup and operation.</p>

      <h2>How difficult is it to connect the wiring and begin operating a Radom plasma unit?</h2>
      <p>It is straightforward to set up. Radom provides a concise 10-minute video guide for connection and startup, along with a detailed user manual, and the Radom support team is always available for assistance via support@radomcorp.com or software@radomcorp.com.</p>

      <h2>Is it difficult to operate a Radom plasma unit?</h2>
      <p>Radom plasma units are designed for ease of use and can be ignited with a single button on the control panel. Ignition and operation can also be controlled through the software interface, where operating parameters can be easily adjusted.</p>

      <h2>Can I change all the parameters of the plasma operation manually?</h2>
      <p>In general, plasma parameters can be adjusted through the control module software; however, it is important to note that the default parameters provided by Radom are already optimized for the most efficient and stable plasma operation. These settings are the result of extensive experimental testing conducted over many hours by Radom engineers. Microwave plasma is a complex, non-equilibrium system that relies on precise physical resonance between the Cerawave™ plasma rings and the magnetron power supply. Because plasma behavior is highly sensitive, the conditions required for reliable ignition and sustained operation are unique and were established through extensive experimentation. The control software serves to synchronize and manage the operation of the system, but the core performance—often considered the “secret sauce”—comes from the plasma torch geometry, the chemical composition of the Cerawave™ rings, the magnetron frequency, and the auto-tuner technology.</p>

      <h2>Which gases can be used to operate a plasma torch?</h2>
      <p>A wide range of non-monatomic gases can be used. For the 1.5-kW system, air, nitrogen, and CO₂ are the most commonly used gases. Higher-power systems (10 kW and above) support a broader selection of process gases, including steam, methane, biogas, and hydrogen, depending on the application and system configuration.</p>

      <h2>Is a plasma torch safe to operate?</h2>
      <p>Plasma torch operation is safe when appropriate precautions are followed. The area around the plasma jet should be secured, and personnel should keep clear of the torch head during ignition due to high voltage. An exhaust system is required during operation, and UV-rated safety glasses must be worn whenever the plasma is active. Fire safety and high-voltage precautions should comply with standard industrial safety requirements.</p>

      <h2>Why is an exhaust system required?</h2>
      <p>When plasma is operated in air, nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) can be generated at elevated concentrations. These gases are hazardous to humans and corrosive to equipment, making proper ventilation and exhaust essential during operation.</p>

      <h2>What electrical power requirements are needed to operate a plasma torch?</h2>
      <p>For the 1.5-kW plasma torch unit, two power inputs are required: the magnetron power supply operates at 208–240 V AC, drawing 10–12 A at 50/60 Hz, while the controller supports 85–264 V AC, drawing up to 1 A at 47–63 Hz.</p>

      <h2>How heavy is a plasma torch system?</h2>
      <p>The MIRA 1.5-kW system consists of three main components: the torch head (~4 kg), control module (~3.5 kg), and power supply (~6.5 kg), for a total weight of approximately 14 kg. This compact, benchtop configuration is well suited for laboratory use. The 10-kW system is larger but still compatible with lab environments, while the 100-kW system is an industrial-scale installation requiring dedicated power infrastructure and approximately 10 × 10 meters of space.</p>

      <h2>Can Radom’s torch be interfaced to some customize reactors?</h2>
      <p>Yes. The Radom R&D team has experience integrating a 100-kW plasma torch with a gasifier for waste-to-energy conversion. In general, Radom plasma torches can be integrated into a variety of reactors, provided the appropriate interface and operating conditions are implemented.</p>

      <h2>How quickly can I change power setpoints, and how long does the system take to settle?</h2>
      <p>Power setpoints can be updated on the order of ~100 ms, and the system tracks changes well. Settling is fast, and ramping is optional—direct step changes are also supported.</p>

      <h2>What is the actual controllable power range, and what’s the lowest power before the plasma extinguishes?</h2>
      <p>The software-defined control range is typically 1000–1500 W (for the Mira system) to ensure stable operation. Hardware may support operation down to ~800 W, but lower limits are enforced in software to prevent plasma extinction.</p>

      <h2>Can I configure or adjust gas pressure and flow safety limits in software?</h2>
      <p>Yes. Minimum and maximum gas pressure and flow safety thresholds are fully configurable in software.</p>

      <h2>Can I start/stop the plasma and control power and gas flow remotely via LabVIEW, PLC, or Python?</h2>
      <p>Yes. Full control—including ignition, shutdown, power, gas flows, and monitoring—is available via a DLL/SDK and can be accessed from LabVIEW, PLCs, Python, or other environments.</p>

      <h2>How fast can I ramp from startup power to 25/50/75/100%, and is ramping required or optional?</h2>
      <p>Ramping speed is user-defined. You can ramp smoothly in steps or jump directly between minimum and maximum power—ramping is optional.</p>

      <h2>What update rate should I use for the mass flow controllers, and what accuracy should I expect?</h2>
      <p>Mass flow controllers have a settling time of a few seconds. They are analytical-grade devices with accuracy on the order of a few percent, suitable for precise plasma control.</p>

      <h2>Do you support custom injectors (center injection, straight vs. bent), and will the standard ignition system still work?</h2>
      <p>Yes. Custom quartz torches with center injection, straight or angled stems, and selectable injector diameters are supported. These designs remain compatible with the standard high-voltage ignitor.</p>

      <h2>After purchase, how do we integrate your system into our control architecture—can the interface be modified, and is source code available?</h2>
      <p>All major functions are exposed via a DLL/SDK. Firmware upgrades can be performed via USB. Source code is not provided, but example code (e.g., Python) and integration support are available.</p>

      <h2>Does torch orientation matter (downward vs. sideways), and are there any mechanical or operational constraints?</h2>
      <p>No. The torch can operate in any orientation, including downward facing, without special mechanical or operational considerations.</p>

      <h2>Can you provide CAD/STEP models and mounting-hole references so we can design our reactor interface accurately?</h2>
      <p>Yes. STEP files and dimensional drawings showing external geometry, flanges, and mounting-hole locations can be provided for accurate mechanical integration.</p>
